BunkerWeb is a next-generation and open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF).

Being a full-featured web server (based on [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) under the hood), it will protect your web services to make them "secure by default". BunkerWeb integrates seamlessly into your existing environments ([Linux](integrations.md#linux), [Docker](integrations.md#docker), [Swarm](integrations.md#swarm), [Kubernetes](integrations.md#kubernetes), â€¦) and is fully configurable (don't panic, there is an [awesome web UI](web-ui.md) if you don't like the CLI) to meet your own use-cases . In other words, cybersecurity is no more a hassle.

BunkerWeb contains primary [security features](security-tuning.md) as part of the core but can be easily extended with additional ones thanks to a [plugin system](plugins.md)).
